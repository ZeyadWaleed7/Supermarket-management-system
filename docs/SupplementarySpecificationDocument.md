# Supplementary Specification Document&#x20;

This document focuses on the non-functional requirements and supplementary specifications for the system, covering aspects such as logging, error handling, security, usability, performance, and other system-wide properties.

---

## Common Functionality

- **Logging and Error Handling**:
  - All errors will be logged for administrative review.
  - The system will handle errors gracefully to prevent system crashes.
- **Pluggable Business Rules**:
  - Rules for promotions, inventory thresholds, and employee scheduling will be configurable.
- **Security**:
  - All operations require user authentication.
  - Role-based access control will ensure appropriate data access.

---

## Usability

- The user interface will be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring minimal training requirements for staff.
- The system will feature:
  - A dashboard for quick access to key features (e.g., inventory, sales reports).
  - Clear navigation and labeled buttons.
  - Color-coded indicators for low stock, sales trends, and employee schedules.
- Accessibility will comply with _WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)_.
- Text and interface elements will be easily visible from 1 meter.

---

## Reliability

- The system will include:
  - Automated backups to prevent data loss.
  - Failover mechanisms to ensure minimal downtime during system failures.
  - Automated tests for validating reliability before deployment.
- Database queries will be optimized for handling large datasets efficiently.

---

## Implementation Constraints

- The application will be built using _Spring Boot (Java)_ for the backend.
- The database will use _MySQL_ for efficient data management.
- The front-end will use _ReactJS_ to provide a dynamic and responsive interface.

---

## Free Open Source Components

- _Spring Boot_ for backend development.
- _Hibernate_ for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- _MySQL_ for database management.
- _Maven_ for dependency management.

---

## Interfaces

### Software Interfaces

- **REST APIs**: The system will expose RESTful endpoints for managing inventory, sales, and employee data.
  - Example: GET /products, POST /sales, PUT /employees/{id}, DELETE /products/{id}.
- **Database Interface**: Hibernate will handle communication with the underlying database.
- **External Notifications**: Integration with third-party notification services for promotional messages or system alerts.

### User Interfaces

- A web-based interface for employees and administrators.
- Mobile-friendly design to allow store managers to access the system on-the-go.

---

## Application-Specific Domain Rules

- Each product must have a unique identifier (e.g., SKU).
- Stock levels must be updated in real-time following sales or inventory changes.
- Employees can only access features based on their roles (e.g., cashiers cannot modify inventory).
- Discounts and promotions must have defined start and end dates.

---

## Pricing

- The system will support different tiers for licensing:
  - _Standard_: Basic inventory and sales management.
  - _Premium_: Advanced analytics, employee management, and multi-branch support.

---

## Operating Systems

- Compatible with _Windows, macOS, and Linux_ for desktop access.
- Mobile access supported via _Android_ and _iOS browsers_.

---

## Design Constraints

- Ensure the system can scale to accommodate supermarkets with multiple branches.
- Support concurrent user access without performance degradation.

---

## Internationalization

- Support for multiple languages, starting with _English_ and _Arabic_.
- Allow users to dynamically switch languages within the application.
